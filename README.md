# Climate-Change-Prediction
# üìò Introduction
Climate change represents one of the most critical challenges facing our planet, with far-reaching impacts on ecosystems, weather patterns, and human societies. However, accurately predicting climate trends is complex due to numerous interacting factors and long-term data requirements. This project introduces a comprehensive climate change prediction system designed to forecast temperature anomalies and climate patterns using historical environmental data.

Unlike traditional statistical methods, this system utilizes advanced time series forecasting models and machine learning algorithms. These models are particularly effective at capturing temporal dependencies and complex relationships in climate data, making them ideal for long-term climate trend analysis.

# üéØ Objectives
Predict climate change indicators based on input features: Historical temperature records, CO2 concentrations, greenhouse gas emissions, sea level data, and atmospheric conditions.

Train and evaluate multiple time series forecasting models to predict future climate trends and temperature anomalies.

Analyze the model's performance using standard regression and time series metrics:

‚úÖ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
‚úÖ Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
‚úÖ Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
‚úÖ R-squared Score

This system aims to provide researchers, policymakers, and environmental organizations with data-driven climate insights, supporting informed decision-making and climate action strategies.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
Pandas (for data manipulation and time series analysis)
Numpy (for numerical operations)
Streamlit (for interactive data visualization dashboard)
Plotly (for dynamic charts and graphs)

# üìä Model Evaluation
The model's performance is rigorously assessed using standard time series forecasting metrics, which may include:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average absolute difference between predictions and actual values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of the average squared differences, giving higher weight to large errors.
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Average absolute percentage difference between predictions and actual values.
R-squared Score: Proportion of variance in climate indicators explained by the model.
